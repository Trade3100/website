            <p>
                So this all started when I wanted to find a packet capture (PCAP) file of an STP negotiation and I had
                to
                jump through many hoops to find one to analyse with Wireshark. The lack of such a file or tools to
                generate it frustrated me and got me interested in the file structure to hopefully understand it well
                enough and maybe do something about this, be it minor, problem i had.</p>
            <p>
                Turns out, it’s a very simple file structure and I found a great resource to help me in my quest; I
                stumbled upon this internet draft of the IETF’s Network Working Group.
                First thing I did was generating a PCAP file through Wireshark with three packets :
            </p>
            <img src="pic1.png" alt="picture of Wireshark" />
            <p>I exported it to the PCAP format and got ran it through a HEX editor :</p>
            <img src="pic2.png" alt="picture of GHex" />
            <p>Once that was done, I tried to find my 3 frames in all this :</p>
            <img src="Hex1.png" alt="picture of GHex" />
            <p>
                Okay, so that was easy, only a few words to go through and understand; My thought process at first was
                as
                follows: this file must contain a header containing some information about the capture, so I isolated
                the first bytes in separate file and tried to do some more research and that’s when I stumbled upon the
                IETF’s draft, you can have more information about the header down below, but for the purposes of this
                rant you just have to know that a PCAP header is 24 bytes long and in this case we have :
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; color: #ffb347;">
                D4 C3 B2 A1 02 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 65 00 00 00
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">0xD4C3B2A1</span> : This sequence identifies that
                packets’ timestamps are recorded in seconds and microseconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">0x02000400</span> : Major and minor version of the
                format. So in this case : Major version = 2, Minor version = 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">0x0000000000000000</span> : Reserved, must be ignored.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">0x00000400</span> : SnapLen; maximum number of bytes
                captured from each packet. 1024 bytes in this case.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">0x65000000</span> : LinkType and additional
                information.
            </p>
            <p>
                All I needed to figure out was the few bits before each packet capture and their meaning. The answer was
                again found in that great article from the IETF.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s take the first packet as an example and see what each bit in the packet record stands for :
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">0x5B063B67</span> : Timestamp (in seconds).
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">0x706F0000</span> : Timestamp (in micro-seconds
                [remember the Magic Sequence]).
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">0x71000000</span> : Captured Packet Length.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">0x71000000</span> : Original Packet Length.
            </p>
            <p>
                And that was today's story, hope you found the process interesting. Now let’s explain the PCAP file in a
                more rigorous way.
            </p>
            <h3 id="interest">What is a PCAP file ?</h3>
            <p>
                Packet CAPture files are a common way to store network traffic, it stores every byte of every packet
                seen by your NIC or in a network in general.
            </p>
            <p>
                PCAP files are easily created and read by a variety of tools, the most famous of which is Wireshark.
            </p>
            <p>
                PCAP files offer a standardized and structured way to store captured traffic, making it easier to
                transport, filter and examine.
            </p>
            <h3>PCAP file format</h3>
            <p>
                All PCAP file start with a header that has the following structure :
            </p>
            <img src="header.png" alt="header of a PCAP file" />
            <p>
                So what does each field mean? Well, it is simple :
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">Magic Number</span> : It can be assigned two value :
                0xA1B2C3D4 to signify that the packet timestamps will be recorded in seconds and microseconds OR
                0xA1B2C34D to signify that the packet timestamps will be recorded in seconds and nanoseconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">Major Version & Minor Version</span> : Specifies the
                version of the format used in the file, it is useful for identifying compatibility issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">Reserved1 & Reserved1</span> : Should not be used and
                should be filled by 0s by the PCAP writer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">SnapLen</span> : Specifies the Maximum number of bytes
                captured from each packet. Any excess will not be stored in the file.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffb347;">LinkType & Additional information</span> : identifies
                the link-layer type of the packet and could contain additional information.
